When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
   When you want to make it available to others on your team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Someone might update something in the repository that you do not want.  Also, the latest update in the GitHub might delete things that you are working on.
